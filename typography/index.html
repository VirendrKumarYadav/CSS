            <p class="p1">Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images, visualizations, and other
                pictures.
                However, more than anything else, they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
                and
                code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's essential that words depend on a
                strong
                foundation of typography.</p>
            <p class="p2">I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design degree. I'm never the person
                choosing a font, scaling type, or finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to
                write
                about typography.</p>
            <p class="p3">On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've contributed to many design
                systems
                that set a foundation for typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation and
                apply it
                to an emerging library of interface components. This article summarizes those patterns.</p>
            <p class="p4">Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights along with fallbacks.
                It
                then explores how to build hierarchy using size, color, additional details like line-height, and
                layering
                responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a system's library (like Article and
                Header)
                as well as custom components made by other teams.</p>
